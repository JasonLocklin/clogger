CLogger is a very simple console based logger for ham radio.

It is a single, very small, bash script that uses the "dialog" tool, and pre-defined variables to quickly collect data about QSOs and save them concat them to a log file.

Logs are concatenated to the log file in ADIF (LOTW Compatible) format, in a easy to read structure,  for easy upload with TQSL, or use with other log processing tools.
